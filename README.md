# React Markdown Previewer

This is a freeCodeCamp certification project for the Front End Libraries certification. It is a React application that allows you to preview Markdown text in real-time.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can open it in your browser and start entering Markdown text in the editor. The preview area will display the rendered HTML output in real-time.

### Markdown Syntax

The application supports the following Markdown syntax:

- Headings: Use one to six `#` symbols for different heading levels.
- Bold and Italic Text: Enclose the text in double `**` or single `*` asterisks for bold or italic respectively.
- Links: Enclose the link text in square brackets `[ ]` and the URL in parentheses `( )`.
- Blockquotes: Use the `>` symbol at the beginning of a line to create a blockquote.
- Code Blocks: Surround the code block with triple backticks (```) before and after.
- Lists: Use hyphens `-` or numbers followed by periods `1.` for unordered and ordered lists respectively.
- Images: Use an exclamation mark `!` followed by square brackets `[ ]` for alt text and parentheses `( )` for the image URL.

Feel free to explore the example Markdown text provided in the initial editor content.

## Credits

This Markdown Previewer was created as a freeCodeCamp certification project for the Front End Libraries certification. It uses React and the [marked.js](https://github.com/markedjs/marked/blob/master/README.md) library for Markdown parsing and rendering.

The project structure and initial code were inspired by freeCodeCamp's curriculum.
